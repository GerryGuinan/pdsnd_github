### Project Title
Git/Github Udacity Bikeshare Project

### Description

#### Introduction

Allowing users to select one of the bikeshare files from major US cities and display various data relating to each file
Second update: file updated during the initial commit.  Looks here who's an eager beaver :-)

#### Overview

Bikeshare is a US company that offers a bike sharing service to customers via an online booking application.  The requirement
in our Udacity proejct is to take various inputs from the user and based on these inputs determine the data set and filters 
that are to be used/applied.

This project uses Python code and incorporates various libraries in order to provide a more efficient output (i.e. dataframes versus dictionaries)

### Requirements

You will need to have a local python compiler in order to run the code.  You will also need the data files (listed below), stored
locally in the same directory you run command to run the file from.

This code was executed using a Python 3 editor.  This hasn't been checked against any earlier versions

### Libraries used

panda - primarily for dataframes
numpy - numeric array
time - date/time manipulation
os - validate which OS is being used
call from subprocess - clear screen command

### Files used
bikeshare_2.py
Various csv files - data files included in .gitignore
 - washington.csv
 - new_york_city.csv
 - chicago.csv
